Design a polished, multi-page portfolio website for "Nexus"—India’s first indigenous hybrid social networking platform—with luxurious and inviting branding, inspired by the provided ornate gold “N” logo.

Brand & Visual Identity:
Use a sophisticated dark background with elegant gold accents drawn from the logo.

Choose modern, clean typography that pairs well with the ornate logo’s luxurious feel.

The tone should convey innovation, trust, community, and warmth.

Site Structure & User Experience:
The website should consist of distinct full-screen page sections, navigable via a sticky top menu with smooth scroll transitions.

On website load, implement a smooth, engaging opening animation featuring:

The Nexus gold logo animating in with a shimmer or glow.

Follow this with a fade or slide-in of the headline and tagline.

Finally, reveal the navigation menu and primary call-to-action (CTA) button with smooth entrance effects.

Each page section should have subtle visual variations to clearly differentiate them while maintaining cohesive brand colors and style.

Content within each section should animate gracefully as the user scrolls down (fade, zoom, slide), creating an interactive and dynamic browsing experience without clutter.
