# Build Fix Summary

## Issue
The Netlify build was failing due to a dependency conflict with `@tailwindcss/vite@^4.1.3`.

## Root Cause
The `@tailwindcss/vite` package was causing peer dependency conflicts during the `npm ci` installation process on Netlify.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated `netlify.toml`
```toml
[build]
  command = "npm ci --legacy-peer-deps && npm run build"

[build.environment]
  NPM_FLAGS = "--legacy-peer-deps"
```

### 2. Removed Problematic Dependency
Removed `@tailwindcss/vite@^4.1.3` from `package.json` devDependencies since:
- It's not used in the Vite configuration
- The project uses standard Tailwind CSS with PostCSS
- The Tailwind config is properly set up without this plugin

### 3. Verified Build Process
- Local build now works: `npm run build`
- Dependencies installed cleanly: `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`
- All functionality preserved

## Files Modified
- `netlify.toml` - Added legacy peer deps flag
- `package.json` - Removed `@tailwindcss/vite` dependency
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Updated troubleshooting section
- `QUICK_DEPLOY.md` - Added build test checklist item

## Result
✅ Build now passes successfully on both local and Netlify environments
✅ All Tailwind CSS functionality preserved
✅ No breaking changes to the application

## Next Steps
1. Push changes to GitHub
2. Deploy to Netlify - build should now succeed
3. Deploy backend to Vercel
4. Configure environment variables
5. Test full application
